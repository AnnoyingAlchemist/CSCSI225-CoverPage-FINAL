            <p>Hey, my name is Brandon Payero, and I worked on the website cover page and the NIM game for this final
                project.<br>
                I am a computer science major studying at USCA, with hopes to become a software engineer one day.</p>

            <h1>TJ Herndon</h1>
            <p>Howdy! They call me TJ. I worked on the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I also slightly polished the website pages that Brandon Payero made, i.e. I butchered main.css and others. I am a computer science major. I aspire to be a farmer. They put electronics in everything nowadays. You just can't redneck things like you used to.</p>
