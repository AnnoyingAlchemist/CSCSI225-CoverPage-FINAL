      <h1>Brandon Payero</h1>
      <p>Hey, my name is Brandon Payero, and I worked on the website cover page, some of the CSS, the database, and the NIM game for this final
        project.
        I am a computer science major studying at USCA, with hopes to become a software engineer one day.</p>

      <h1>TJ Herndon</h1>
      <p>Howdy! They call me TJ. I worked on the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I also slightly polished the website pages that
        Brandon Payero made, i.e. I butchered main.css and others. I am a computer science major. I aspire to be a
        farmer. They put electronics in everything nowadays. You just can't redneck things like you used to.</p>
